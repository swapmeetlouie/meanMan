# DoN OSBP Small Business Dashboards

Updated MEAN stack version of former LAMP based dashboards.  Now includes splash page with links for dashboards (tested), year-to-date data (in development), United States spending maps (in development), and FPDS-NG E-Z Search (in development).  

## Development Server Notes

Development application is using MongoDB-Mongoose backend but OMB Max based application will use IBM Db2 OData service.  Must use latest @swimlane for CSS chart changes to be reflected properly.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
